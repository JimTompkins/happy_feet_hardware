## [Unreleased]

## [0.12] - 2023-05-05

### Added

### Fixed
- changed J1 slots from board outline to drill slots.  These slots are 0.8mm wide
and have (sometimes) been left out of the board fab due to the width being less
than the board routing bit diameter.

### Changed
- moved J1 1mm outboard to overhang board edge
- added note re J2 optional population for the developer version

### Removed

## [0.11] - 2023-04-24

### Added
- J2 cJTAG header to be optionally populated for developer use.  
Note that this header does not fit in the standard HappyFeet housing and so requires a custom lid.
